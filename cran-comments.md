## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* added remaining missing \value fields to help files
* used double quotes in paper title

In previous submissions I:
* added references to the description (the STL paper has no doi or other URL)
* added quotes around package name in title
* removed \dontrun{} from examples (and added some more)
* added \value to documented functions
* replaced instances of cat() with warning() so they may be suppressed
* this package has no additional system dependencies

## Test environments
* local ubuntu 18.04, R 3.6.3
* ubuntu 18.04 (on travis-ci) R oldrel, release, and devel
* macos (on travis-ci), R release
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
