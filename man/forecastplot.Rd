\title{Forecast plot}
\usage{
forecastplot(vars, xlab = "Time", ylab = "", multiplicative = FALSE,
  show = TRUE, model.lim = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{vars}{\code{iNZightTS} object}

\item{xlab}{x axis label}

\item{ylab}{a title for the y axis}

\item{multiplicative}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, a multiplicative model is used,
otherwise an additive model is used by default.}

\item{show}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, draw the plot by default.}

\item{model.lim}{time limits to use for modelling}
}
\value{
A multiple time series of the predicted values with columns fit,
lwr and upr for the predicted values and the lower and upper bounds
respectively.
}
\description{
Plot a raw time series together with it's fitted curve and add
forecasts and prediction intervals to the end.
}
\details{
The predictions and prediction intervals are the result of models
fitted by the Holt-Winters method. The amount of predicted
observations is calculated by 2 * \code{freq}, where \code{freq} is
the frequency of the time series object.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
z <- iNZightTS(ldeaths)
forecastplot(z)
