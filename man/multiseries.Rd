\title{Compare multiple timeseries}
\usage{
multiseries(x, ...)

multiseries.1(vars, multiplicative = FALSE, xlab = "Time", ylab = "",
  t = 0, ...)

multiseries.2p(vars, multiplicative = FALSE, xlab = "Time", ylab = "",
  t = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{iNZightMTS object containing data}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed onto specific methods.}

\item{vars}{iNZightTS object with the data and frequency information included}

\item{multiplicative}{logical, use multiplicate series?}

\item{xlab}{x axis label}

\item{ylab}{y axis label}

\item{t}{smoothing parameter}
}
\description{
Draw a plot to compare 2 or more timeseries with each
other. The resulting plot contains the original timeseries as well as
plots showing the season effects of each timeseries, if the frequency
is greater than 1.
}
\details{
\code{x} is an \code{\link{iNZightMTS}} object containing some
data for which timeseries objects can be created. The data columns
used for the plotting are those that are used in the \code{\link{iNZightMTS}}
object.

The frequency used for the plotting is also stored in \code{x}.
